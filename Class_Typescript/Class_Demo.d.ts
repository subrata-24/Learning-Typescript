/**
 TypeScript Classes & Access Modifiers:
 - Classes are blueprints for creating objects. TypeScript adds Access Modifiers to control the visibility of properties. 'public' - (default) allows access to the class member from anywhere, 'private' - ensures data can only be accessed  within the class, protecting it from external interference.'protected' - allows access to the class member from itself and any classes that inherit it, which is covered in the inheritance section below
