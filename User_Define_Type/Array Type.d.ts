    Arrays in TypeScript can be typed to ensure all elements within the list follow a specific data type. This prevents mixed-type errors that are common in standard JavaScript.

    Use 'type[]' for simple arrays and '(type1 | type2)[]' for mixed arrays.
    The 'readonly' modifier is excellent for data that should remain constant (like config lists).
    TypeScript provides full IntelliSense for array methods (like map, filter, reduce) based on the type of elements inside.
