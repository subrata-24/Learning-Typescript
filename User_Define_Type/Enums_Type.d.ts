/**
    TypeScript Enums (Numeric, String, and Heterogeneous)
    Enums (Enumerations) allow a developer to define a set of named constants.They make code more readable by using descriptive names instead of mysterious numbers or strings.
 */
export {};
/**
 - Numeric Enums: Support "Reverse Mapping" (we can get the name from the number).
 - String Enums: Do NOT support reverse mapping but are easier to read in logs.
 - Mixed Enums: Generally discouraged in professional code as they lead to confusion.It is better to stay consistent with one type.
 - Const Enums: Use 'const enum' if you want to improve performance by removing the Enum object entirely during compilation.
